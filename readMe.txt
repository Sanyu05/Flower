-- What does the Program do --
# The program takes in a .csv file from the user 
# Reads and stores the data from the file locally 
# Sorts the data columns into two types -> numeric and string
# Displays a summary of the data (including mean, min, max etc) 
# Allows the user to try to convert an incorrectly converted string column to numeric 
# Gives the user to plot the data - currently the options are [bar, line, scatter, histogram, pie]
# Lets the user chose the columns they want to plot on the x-axis and y-axis
# Stays in loop to create multiple plots

-- How to use the app --
